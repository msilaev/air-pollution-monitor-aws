## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ (tested with Python 3.11)
- Git
- (Optional) AWS CLI configured for S3 access
- (Optional) MLflow server for model tracking

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd air_pollution
```

#### 2. Create Virtual Environment
```bash
# Using venv
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install core dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Make sure these packages are included in requirements.txt:
# - griffe (required for Prefect worker)
# - geopy (required for API)

# For development (includes testing and linting tools)
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # if available
```

#### 4. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
# MLflow Configuration
MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=sqlite:///mlflow.db
MLFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT_URL=your-s3-endpoint  # Optional

# AWS Configuration (Optional)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
AWS_S3_DATA_BUCKET=your-bucket-name

# Application Configuration
PYTHONPATH=.
```

##### S3 Data and Artifact Storage

The use of AWS S3 for storing data and model artifacts is controlled by the `USE_S3` flag in `src/config.py`:

```python
USE_S3 = False  # Set to True to enable S3 storage for data and artifacts
```

- When `USE_S3 = True`, the application will read from and write to S3 buckets as configured in your environment variables.
- When `USE_S3 = False`, all data and artifacts will be stored locally in the `data/` and `models/` directories.

Update this flag according to your deployment or development needs.

#### 5. Verify Installation
```bash
# Run tests to verify everything is working
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Check if core modules can be imported
python -c "from src.models.pollution_predictor import PollutionPredictor; print('✅ Installation successful!')"
```

### Quick Start
```bash
# Start the API server
python -m src.api.app

# Start the Streamlit dashboard
streamlit run src/frontend/dashboard_simplified.py

# Start MLFLOW server
mlflow server --backend-store-uri ./mlruns --default-artifact-root s3://mlflow-artifacts-remote-2025/artifacts --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000


# Start Prefect orchestration server
prefect server start

# Run data collection (if configured)
python -m src.data.data_ingestion

# Run orchestrated training pipeline
python -c "from flows.main_flows import training_pipeline_flow; training_pipeline_flow()"

# Run orchestrated full pipeline
python -c "from flows.main_flows import full_mlops_pipeline_flow; full_mlops_pipeline_flow()"
```

### Docker Installation & Orchestration



#### 1. Build and start all services with Docker Compose:
```powershell
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

#### 2. Register a Prefect flow as a deployment (example: full MLOps pipeline):
```powershell
docker compose exec prefect-worker prefect deployment build flows/main_flows.py:full_mlops_pipeline_flow -n full-mlops-deployment

docker compose exec prefect-worker prefect deployment apply full_mlops_pipeline_flow-deployment.yaml
```

```powershell
docker compose exec prefect-worker prefect worker start -p default-agent-pool
# Start the Prefect worker after registering and applying the deployment above. This command will execute scheduled and manual flow runs.
```
 Replace `full_mlops_pipeline_flow` with another flow name if needed (see `flows/main_flows.py`).

#### 3. Access the Prefect UI:
- Open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser.
- You will see your registered deployments and can trigger flow runs from the UI.

#### 4. Access other services:
- **Streamlit dashboard:** [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)
- **API (FastAPI):** [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- **MLflow Tracking UI:** [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

#### 5. Manual flow run (optional):
You can also run a flow manually inside the worker container:
```powershell
docker compose exec prefect-worker python -m flows.main_flows
```

#### 6. Scheduled tasks

You can schedule individual Prefect tasks to run automatically using the Prefect CLI. For example:

- **Schedule model training every week:**
  ```powershell
  docker compose exec prefect-worker prefect deployment build flows/tasks.py:train_model_flow -n train-model-weekly --cron "0 8 * * 3" --timezone "Europe/Helsinki"
  # it's 2 am on mondays, 0 8 * * 3 is 8 am on wednesday

  docker compose exec prefect-worker prefect deployment apply train_model_flow-deployment.yaml
  ```
  This will run the training flow every Monday at 2 AM Helsinki time.

- **Schedule model validation every 6 hours:**
  ```powershell
  docker compose exec prefect-worker prefect deployment build flows/tasks.py:validate_model_flow -n validate-model-6h --interval 21600 --timezone "Europe/Helsinki"
  docker compose exec prefect-worker prefect deployment apply validate_model_flow-deployment.yaml
  ```
  This will run the validation flow every 6 hours.

  ```powershell
  docker compose exec prefect-worker prefect worker start -p default-agent-pool
  # Start the Prefect worker after registering and applying the deployment above. This command will execute scheduled and manual flow runs.
  ```



After applying, scheduled tasks will appear in the Prefect UI and run automatically at the specified intervals.
> **Note:** Before starting, replace `docker-compose-template.yml` with `docker-compose.yml` and fill in your real AWS credentials in the environment variables section.

- Some PyArrow compatibility warnings may appear on Windows but don't affect test results
- The test suite is designed to run in CI/CD environments without external dependencies

## Frontend: Streamlit Dashboard

The project includes an interactive dashboard for visualizing air pollution predictions and data. You can run the dashboard locally using Streamlit.

### Start the Dashboard (Frontend)

From the project root, run:

```bash
streamlit run src/frontend/dashboard.py
```

- The dashboard will be available at: http://localhost:8501
- Make sure your API server is running if the dashboard depends on live predictions.



## Orchestration with Prefect

The project uses [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/) for workflow orchestration, providing automated data collection, model training, and prediction pipelines with monitoring and error handling.

### 🔧 **Prefect Setup**

#### 1. Start Prefect Server
```bash
# Start the local Prefect server
prefect server start

# The server will be available at: http://127.0.0.1:4200
# Dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:4200
# API docs: http://127.0.0.1:4200/docs
```

#### 2. Configure Prefect Client
```bash
# In a new terminal, set the API URL
prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4200/api

# Verify configuration
prefect config view
```

#### 3. Create a Work Pool (Optional)
```bash
# Create a local work pool for running flows
prefect work-pool create --type process local-pool

# Start a worker
prefect worker start --pool local-pool
```

### 🔄 **Available Workflows**

#### **Training Pipeline Flow**
Orchestrates the complete model training process:
- Data collection from multiple pollution monitoring stations
- Data quality validation
- Model training with MLflow tracking
- Model validation and registration

```python
# Run training pipeline programmatically
from flows.main_flows import training_pipeline_flow

result = training_pipeline_flow()
```

#### **Prediction Pipeline Flow**
Handles real-time predictions:
- Collects latest pollution data
- Loads trained model from MLflow
- Generates predictions
- Stores results for API consumption

```python
# Run prediction pipeline
from flows.main_flows import prediction_pipeline_flow

predictions = prediction_pipeline_flow()
```

#### **Monitoring Pipeline Flow**
Monitors data quality and model performance:
- Data drift detection
- Model performance tracking
- Alert generation for anomalies

```python
# Run monitoring pipeline
from flows.main_flows import monitoring_pipeline_flow

monitoring_results = monitoring_pipeline_flow()
```

### 🏃 **Running Flows**

#### **Method 1: Python Scripts**
```bash
# Training pipeline
python -c "from flows.main_flows import training_pipeline_flow; training_pipeline_flow()"


# Prediction pipeline
python -c "from flows.main_flows import prediction_pipeline_flow; prediction_pipeline_flow()"


# Monitoring pipeline
python -c "from flows.main_flows import monitoring_pipeline_flow; monitoring_pipeline_flow()"
```

#### **Method 2: Prefect CLI**
```bash
# Deploy flows to Prefect server
python flows/deployments.py

# Run deployed flows
prefect deployment run "training-pipeline/default"
prefect deployment run "prediction-pipeline/default"
```

#### **Method 3: Scheduled Runs**
```python
# flows/deployments.py contains scheduled deployments
# Training: Daily at 2 AM
# Predictions: Every 4 hours
# Monitoring: Every 2 hours
```

### 📊 **Monitoring & Observability**

#### **Prefect Dashboard**
- **Flow Runs**: View execution history and status
- **Task Runs**: Detailed task-level monitoring
- **Logs**: Real-time and historical logs
- **Metrics**: Performance and success rates

#### **MLflow Integration**
- **Experiment Tracking**: All training runs logged
- **Model Registry**: Versioned model artifacts
- **Metrics Comparison**: Training vs validation performance

#### **Data Quality Monitoring**
```python
# Built-in data quality checks
from flows.tasks import check_data_quality_task

quality_report = check_data_quality_task(data_type="training")
print(f"Quality Score: {quality_report['quality_score']}")
```

### 🔧 **Individual Tasks**

You can also run individual Prefect tasks for development and testing:

```python
# Data collection
from flows.tasks import collect_training_data_task
data = collect_training_data_task.fn(chunk_size_hours=168, week_number=2)

# Model training
from flows.tasks import train_model_task
metrics = train_model_task.fn()

# Model validation
from flows.tasks import validate_model_task
validation = validate_model_task.fn()

# Data quality check
from flows.tasks import check_data_quality_task
quality = check_data_quality_task.fn(data_type="training")
```

### 🚨 **Error Handling & Retries**

Prefect flows include robust error handling:
- **Automatic Retries**: Failed tasks retry with exponential backoff
- **Failure Notifications**: Configurable alerts for failed flows
- **Graceful Degradation**: Partial failures don't stop entire pipeline
- **State Management**: Track and resume from failed states

### 📈 **Production Configuration**

#### **Environment Variables**
```bash
# .env file configuration
PREFECT_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4200/api
PREFECT_WORK_POOL=local-pool
PREFECT_LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# For production deployments
PREFECT_CLOUD_API_KEY=your-cloud-api-key  # If using Prefect Cloud
```

#### **Scaling Considerations**
- **Work Pools**: Configure multiple pools for different task types
- **Concurrency**: Set limits for parallel task execution
- **Resource Allocation**: Configure CPU/memory limits per task
- **Storage**: Use remote storage for large datasets

### 🧪 **Testing Orchestration**

The project includes comprehensive tests for Prefect components:

```bash
# Test all Prefect tasks and flows
python -m pytest tests/test_flows.py -v

# Test individual task functions
python -m pytest tests/test_flows.py::TestPrefectTasks::test_collect_training_data_task_success -v

# Test flow orchestration
python -m pytest tests/test_flows.py::TestPrefectFlows -v
```

### 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

#### **Common Issues**
1. **Server Connection**: Ensure `PREFECT_API_URL` is set correctly
2. **Task Failures**: Check logs in Prefect dashboard
3. **Import Errors**: Verify all dependencies are installed
4. **Database Issues**: Reset Prefect database if corrupted

#### **Debug Commands**
```bash
# Check Prefect configuration
prefect config view

# View server status
prefect server database reset  # If database issues

# Check flow state
prefect flow-run ls --limit 10
```

#### **🔄 Infrastructure Management**

##### **Scaling Services**
```bash
# Scale API service to 3 instances
aws ecs update-service --cluster air-pollution-cluster --service api-service --desired-count 3

# Scale dashboard service
aws ecs update-service --cluster air-pollution-cluster --service dashboard-service --desired-count 2
```

##### **Updating Application**
```bash
# Rebuild and push new image
docker build -f Dockerfile.api -t air-pollution/api:latest .
docker tag air-pollution/api:latest 909251725488.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/air-pollution/api:latest
docker push 909251725488.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/air-pollution/api:latest

# Force new deployment
aws ecs update-service --cluster air-pollution-cluster --service api-service --force-new-deployment
```

##### **Monitoring and Logs**
```bash
# View service logs
aws logs tail /ecs/air-pollution-api --follow

# Check service health
aws ecs describe-services --cluster air-pollution-cluster --services api-service
```

#### **💰 Cost Optimization**

The deployment is designed for cost efficiency:

- **ECS Fargate**: Pay only for running containers
- **RDS t3.micro**: Free tier eligible for 12 months
- **S3**: Pay for storage used
- **ALB**: Minimal cost for traffic routing

**Estimated Monthly Cost**: $20-50 USD (depending on usage)

#### **🔒 Security Features**

- **VPC with private subnets** for database isolation
- **Security groups** with minimal required access
- **ALB** for SSL termination (when configured)
- **IAM roles** with least privilege access
- **RDS encryption** at rest

#### **🚨 Troubleshooting**

##### **Common Issues:**

1. **ECS Services Not Starting**
   ```bash
   # Check service events
   aws ecs describe-services --cluster air-pollution-cluster --services api-service

   # Check task definition
   aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition air-pollution-api:latest
   ```

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check RDS status
   aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier air-pollution-postgres

   # Verify security groups
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids sg-xxxxxx
   ```

3. **Load Balancer Health Checks Failing**
   ```bash
   # Check target group health
   aws elbv2 describe-target-health --target-group-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:...
   ```

##### **Log Analysis:**
```bash
# API service logs
aws logs tail /ecs/air-pollution-api --follow

# Database logs (if enabled)
aws logs tail /aws/rds/instance/air-pollution-postgres/error --follow
```

#### **🧹 Cleanup**

To destroy the infrastructure and avoid ongoing costs:

```bash
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform destroy -var="db_password=your-secure-password" -auto-approve

# Remove ECR images
aws ecr delete-repository --repository-name air-pollution/api --force
aws ecr delete-repository --repository-name air-pollution/dashboard --force
aws ecr delete-repository --repository-name air-pollution/prefect --force

# Remove S3 state bucket (optional)
aws s3 rb s3://air-pollution-terraform-state --force
```

### 🐳 **Local Docker Deployment**

For development and testing, you can run the entire stack locally using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build

# Start in detached mode
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

**Local Service URLs:**
- API: http://localhost:8000
- Dashboard: http://localhost:8501
- MLflow: http://localhost:5000
- Prefect: http://localhost:4200
